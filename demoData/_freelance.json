      "summery": "<p>I am a versatile web developer experienced in building user-friendly and feature-rich web applications. I have worked on various projects, including a fully-featured examination web app and a blood donation diary MVP. These applications enable seamless exam setup and efficient management of donation records for NGOs in the blood donation field.</p><p>In addition to project-specific work, I have played a key role in developing and maintaining online examination platforms. One notable project involved constructing an online examination platform from scratch, incorporating a Laravel RESTful API, a NextJS frontend, and a Vue.JS admin panel. I focused on designing a new user interface, implementing progress tracking charts, and enhancing user experience throughout the site. I also contributed to backend development, handling server management scripting, database operations, RESTful API development, socket implementation, Redis cache configuration, Laravel queue optimization, email handling, and Laravel job execution.</p><p>I have made significant contributions to mezohub.com, a platform dedicated to server management and application deployment. Here, I championed Test-Driven Development (TDD) to ensure codebase stability and spearheaded the migration of the front-end architecture from NextJS to Laravel, Inertia, and React. Collaborating closely with UI/UX designers, I transformed Figma designs into functional Tailwind CSS and React components, enhancing the user interface and experience.</p>",
